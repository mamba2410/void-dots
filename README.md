I'm fairly new to ricing and not a master at Linux so let me know if I'm doing anything completely wrong.

<code>linkfiles</code> moves old dotfiles to a new directory and symlinks the dots in this repo to where they should be.
<code>makedirs</code> creates a directory tree which I think makes more sense and leads to a cleaner <code>/home/$USER</code>.
